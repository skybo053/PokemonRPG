# Pokemon RPG

 - Top down, 2D perspective RPG, styled after those of the 90's.  
 - Combines elements from Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana, etc.
 - Uses sprites and music found online (this is a fun coding project for me to experiment, not a game I'm trying to sell)

Simply run the executable jar file, PokemonRPG.jar to play and view current progress.
