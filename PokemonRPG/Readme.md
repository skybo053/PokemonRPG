# Pokemon RPG

 - Top down, 2D perspective RPG, styled after those of the 90's.  
 - Combines elements from Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana, etc.
 - Uses sprites and music found online (this is a fun coding project for me to experiment, not a game I'm trying to sell)

Simply run the executable jar file, PokemonRPG.jar to play and view current progress (make sure jar file is in same directory with com and Resource folder)
